How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs starts with communication with the user. Holding meetings, reading reviews or conducting interviews helps me obtain crucial, continous feedback. Hearing their needs, and discussing how to implement them is one of the first steps towards interpreting them in user stories. Creating user stories helps collect this information and make it digestable - they are simple and understandable by both users and developers, and bridge the communication between both. User stories ensures the most important part of feedback is constantly at the forefront and that user needs are prioritized. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I can use Agile methodology to help approach developing programs, boosting my efficiency and adaptability while providing me a guideline for how to work on complex projects in a certain timeframe. Some processes I'd like to incorporate include Scrum, user stories, and daily standups. These are effective when doing team oriented work. Scrum provides a framework with its own principles and practices that are widely used today, and can even translate into enterprise level projects. User stories are most useful when developing, because they provide important user need information in a way everyone can understand. Daily standups are great to incorporate into future developmental work because they help reorient the focus on what needs to be done by going over progress and identifying impediments. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member means to hold the technical and soft skills necessary to function as a crucial member of the team. Technical knowledge is the first step; soft skills, like transparency, communication, adaptability, or problem solving, are the most prominent abilities to have in projects or other collaborative functions. Having these skills, and the skill to adapt and learn, are what makes a team member great. That is because every team member must contribute to the work, and one's inherent value to a team comes from these skills.
